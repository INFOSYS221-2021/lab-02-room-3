Questioin 5
- Step 1: Understand Mathematical problem, Can have more than one solutions

- Step 2: Strategy Trial and Error, dur to the time constraint, stop when you get one solution

- Step 3: Solve (3 + 1) / (3 / 6) = 8

- Step 4: Look Back Is the solution optimal? Can it be done with fewer steps?
